A shared music player

## Music library
On the left there's a library of music.  You can on the top to click on a group and scroll through by album, artist or song.  If you double click it will show all the songs in whatever group.  And you can drag a group or an individual song to the right where there's a running playlist.


## Playlist
The playlist on the right is shared for everyone connected. You can change the current song using arrow keys left and right.  You also drag and double click songs on the playlist to remove songs.


## Chat
There's also a chat.
